# Employee-template-engine

Installation: inquirer

This application, when run, will prompt the user in the terminal with a series of questions and depending on answers to previous questions will ask different questions. Then it will take the answers and render them into html and post them on the site. This app gave us practice with node, constructor classes and thinking in terms of OOP and TDD. I found this assignment flowed easier than expected. After getting started I realized I had retained a lot more information than I had originally thought. My biggest hiccup was getting my code to work with the preset code. After taking my code step by step I discovered I had not been saving my response as one of the constructed classes but as a normal object so the methods in the render function weren't working. After that writing the html file went smoothly.
